## 🔧 Main Parts of a Computer

Here are the basic parts that make up most computers:

### 1. **Monitor**
- It's the screen where you see everything.
- Shows text, images, videos, etc.

### 2. **Keyboard**
- Used to type letters, numbers, and commands.

### 3. **Mouse**
- Helps you move around and click things on the screen.

### 4. **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
- The brain of the computer.
- It processes everything and controls what the computer does.

### 5. **RAM (Memory)**
- Temporary storage for running programs.
- The more RAM, the faster your computer can do things.

### 6. **Hard Drive / SSD (Storage)**
- Where your files, programs, and the operating system are stored.
- SSDs are faster than hard drives.

### 7. **Motherboard**

## 🔒 Why is This Important in Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is about protecting computers and data. If you don’t understand how a computer works, you won’t know what you’re trying to protect.

For example:
- If you don’t know what RAM is, you won’t understand **how malware hides** in memory.
- If you don’t know what storage is, you won’t know **where to look for stolen files**.

## ✅ Summary

- A computer is a machine that takes input, processes it, and gives output.
-It has many parts — like monitor, keyboard, CPU, RAM, and storage.
- Knowing how a computer works is the **first step** in learning cybersecurity.
