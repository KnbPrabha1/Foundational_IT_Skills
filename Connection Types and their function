# 🌐 Connection Types and Their Functions – For Beginners

Computers don’t work alone — they often need to **connect** with other computers, devices, or the internet to share information. In this guide, you’ll learn about different **connection types** and their **basic functions**.

## 🧩 What Is a Connection?

A **connection** allows your computer or device to communicate with:
- Other devices (like printers, phones)
- The internet (websites, apps)
- Servers (where data is stored)

These connections can be **wired** or **wireless**.

## 🔌 Types of Connections

### 1. **Wired Connection (Using Cables)**

#### a) **Ethernet**
- Connects your computer to a network or router using a cable.
- 🔹 **Stable and fast** connection.
- 🔹 Often used in offices, desktops, and gaming.

#### b) **USB (Universal Serial Bus)**
- Used to connect devices like pen drives, keyboards, or smartphones.
- 🔹 Transfers data and power between devices.

#### c) **HDMI / VGA**
- Used to connect a computer to a monitor or projector.
- 🔹 Sends video (and audio in HDMI) signals.

### 2. **Wireless Connection (No Cables)**

#### a) **Wi-Fi**
- Connects to the internet without cables.
- 🔹 Most common at home, in cafes, and on phones.
- 🔹 Can be protected with passwords (WPA2, WPA3).

#### b) **Bluetooth**
- Short-range connection for devices like wireless headphones, keyboards, etc.
- 🔹 Great for file transfer between phones or connecting accessories.

#### c) **Infrared (IR)**
- Old technology used in TV remotes or early mobile phones.
- 🔹 Very limited range and speed.

#### d) **Mobile Data (4G/5G)**
- Internet connection via SIM card on phones.

## 🔐 Why Do Connections Matter in Cybersecurity?

Every connection is a **potential risk**. Cyber attackers can:
- Break into unsecured Wi-Fi networks.
- Send malicious files over USB or Bluetooth.
- Intercept data sent through the internet.

So in cybersecurity, we focus on:
- Using **secure protocols** (HTTPS, VPN)
- Avoiding **public Wi-Fi** for sensitive work
- Scanning USB devices before using them
- Keeping Bluetooth off when not in use
